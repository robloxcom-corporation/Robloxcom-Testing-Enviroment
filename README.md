PI-Blocks calculates PI:
Works by simulating physics collisions with blocks of adjustable masses and a static wall. The resulting number of collisions is a order magnitude of PI. You can use the command 'setup(power, accuracy) or 'setup(power, "auto")' in the console and press start to manually select paramaters for the blocks.
